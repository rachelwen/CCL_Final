# CCL_Final

live site: dimsum-portrait.now.sh

This is Dim Sum Portrait, a final project for creative coding lab, by me, Rachel Wen.

The main page has multiple sketches, each representing a dim sum dish. The main dish in the center is supposed to be soup, with 
your face as the seasoning :) this was made by using clmtrackr.js. Each of the other dishes are made based off of the coding train's 
steering tutorial. When the user hovers over each sketch, the mouse will turn into chopsticks that attempt to grab the dim sum. 

This project was inspired by my cravings for dimsum, as I can't have it right now. The way the dimsum runs away from the chopsticks echos
this feeling - there are dimsum resturaunts right down the street, yet I can't get to them. So close, yet so far!!

Anyways hope u enjoy my fun sketch I learned a lot through this process :)
